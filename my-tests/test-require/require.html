	<h1>Require</h1>
	<h2>Log:</h2>
	<div id="log"></div>
	<h3>Note 1</h3>
	<p>If you reload a few times you will probably notice that the order of the log entries changes. Even so, all of the wn.require() calls are still successful.</p>
	<p>That is because wn.require() uses anynchronous loading to speed up the page load and wn() keeps track on the dependecies and ticks off loaded files as the browser receives them.</p>
	<h3>Note 2</h3>
	<p>It is ok when the files down the dependency chain require some other files already requested. Each required file is loaded only once.</p>
